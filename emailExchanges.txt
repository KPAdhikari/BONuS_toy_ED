Hello all,

I've been working in a toy pad event display to visualize the shape of the tracks on the sensor pad for the small study of track finder through the pad info. I called toy because it only shows the pads "lighten" by the particle. Perhaps in the future, some color code associated with the time or the multiplicity could be added. Future...

It's kernel is based on an event display I use with the GRINCH detector prototype, so maybe there are pieces of code without any sense, but they don't interfere with the display.

Right now, it is a ROOT script, and the user should modify the input file, the tree name and the pad variable according to their root file format. I think it is very straigh forward how to do it.

If you are curious, the repository is this one:
